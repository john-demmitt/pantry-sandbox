A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/raad/pen/EzFAv.

 Inspired by several examples out there, my take on *pure css glass buttons, with glow effects.
Combines box-shadows and background gradients, with 2 highlight variants.

So far, tested on:

 ● Mozilla Firefox 18.0.2 - Windows 7  
 ● Google Chrome 24.0.1312.57 - Windows 7  
 ● Opera 12.14 - Windows 7  
 ● IE9 - Windows 7  

(\* ok, so I cheated a bit with IE9 and used SVG, but hey IE9 cheats by pretending to be a browser!)
